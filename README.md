KIZUNANO WALLET is a fork of the popular Nano wallet [Nault](https://github.com/Nault/Nault) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [KIZUNANO COIN](https://github.com/kizunanocoin/node) either directly in your browser at [wallet.kizunanocoin.com](https://wallet.kizunanocoin.com).

Seamless integration with any KIZUNANO COIN compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained are some of the main features. Those together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.
